# SkipList
A simple implementation of a SkipList using generics. 

- Faster searching, inserting and deletion. (log(n)).
- Uses a random coin flip to decide if an element will be added to next level.
- Can add a sentinal level with only "-oo" and "+oo" linked to each other and bottom levels.
- All elements must be on bottom level.
